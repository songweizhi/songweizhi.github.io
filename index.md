### About me

I hold a Master degree on Marine Microbiology and a PhD degree on Microbiology and Immunology (University of New South Wales (**UNSW**), Sydney, Australia). 
After my graduation, I continued my research as a Postdoctoral Fellow at **UNSW** (2019-2022) and received a Seed Grant for Early Career Researchers from the university.
In early 2023, I relocated to The Chinese University of Hong Kong (**CUHK**) to expand my knowledge on Phylogenomics. 
Later the same year, I joined The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (**HKUST**) as a Research Assistant Professor to continue my research on Bioinformatics and animal-microbe symbioses.

Interested in bioinformatics, phylogenomics or animal-microbe symbioses? Shoot me an email to explore possibilities!
