### About me

My name is Weizhi SONG (pronounced as “whizz~”), I hold a Master degree on Marine Microbiology and a PhD degree on Microbiology and Immunology (University of New South Wales (**UNSW**), Australia). 
After my graduation, I continued my research as a **Postdoctoral Fellow** at **UNSW** (2019-2023) and received a Seed Grant for Early Career Researchers from the university.
Later in 2023, I joined The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (**HKUST**) as a **Research Assistant Professor** to continue my research on Bioinformatics and animal-microbe symbioses.
