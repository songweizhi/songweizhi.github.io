## About me

I hold a Bachelor degree on Biological Engineering (Shandong University of Architecture and Engineering, Shandong, China, 2009), 
a Master degree on Marine Microbiology (The First Institute of Oceanography, Ministry of Natural Resources, China, 2012), 
and a PhD degree on Microbiology and Immunology (University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, 2019). 

After my graduation, I continued my research as a Postdoctoral Fellow at UNSW (2019-2022) and received a Seed Grant for Early Career Researchers from the university.
In early 2023, I relocated to The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) to expand my knowledge on Phylogenomics. 
Later the same year, I joined The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) as a Research Assistant Professor to continue my research on Bioinformatics and animal-microbe symbioses.
