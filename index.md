## About me

I hold a Bachelor degree on Biological Engineering from Shandong University of Architecture and Engineering (2009), 
a Master degree on Marine Microbiology from The First Institute of Oceanography, Ministry of natural resources, China (2012) 
and a PhD degree on Microbiology and Immunology from the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia (2019). 
After my graduation, I continued my research as a Postdoctoral Fellow at UNSW (2019-2022) and received a Seed Grant from the university for Early Career Researchers.

In early 2023, I relocated to The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) to expand my knowledge on phylogenomics. 
Later the same year, I joined The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) as a Research Assistant Professor to continue my research on bioinformatics and the evolution of microbe-host symbiosis.
